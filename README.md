# Ripples

Animated model of raindrops landing on a gently flowing river. An initial investigation into game theory using Python's Turtles module. After this I moved on to Java/LibGDX so that I could create more powerful multi-agent software simulations of real-world phenomena.

To execute the program:

- Ensure that you have Python's Tkinter module installed. As root:
    - # apt-get install python-tk

- Open a terminal.

- cd to the directory where you downloaded the files.

- Call python __main__.py . (This may require you to specify a particular version of Python.)
