# Ripples
Time to get rid of that TV and instead watch my relaxing rainbow ripples on a rapidly running river!

Animated model of raindrops landing on a gently flowing river. An initial investigation into game theory using Python's Turtles module. After this I moved on to Java/LibGDX so that I could create more powerful multi-agent software simulations of real-world phenomena.

To execute the program:

1. Ensure that you have Python's Tkinter module installed.

2. Open a terminal.

3. cd to the directory where you downloaded the files.

4. Call python __main__.py . (This may require you to specify a particular version of Python.)

5. Relax and zen out.
